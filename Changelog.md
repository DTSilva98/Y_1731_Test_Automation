# Changelog

## Version 2 Update Summary
This version focuses on code modularity, maintainability, user experience, and error handling to ensure a more efficient and reliable implementation.

## Changes and Improvements
### 1. Modular Code Structure
- Refactored code into separate modules:
  - `main.py`: Program execution and interaction.
  - `connection.py`: Device connection and disconnection.
  - `saos_version6.py`: Command generation for SAOS v6.
  - `saos_version10.py`: Command generation for SAOS v10.

### 2. Enhanced Connection Handling
- Modularized connection logic in `connection.py` with improved structure and potential for retry mechanisms.

### 3. Robust Input Validation
- Added error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) for input validation to prevent crashes.

### 4. User-Controlled Test Conservation
- Users can review and choose to retain or delete test configurations, ensuring proper cleanup.

### 5. Expanded Scalability
- Improved structure for adding support for future SAOS versions and other devices.

### **Conclusion**
The Version 2 enhances modularity, error handling, user interaction, and scalability, providing a more robust and user-friendly implementation while simplifying future expansions.
